Background
----------

You are going about doing your own business, when you suddenly are
transported to the middle of a dark forest in a far away land. You have no
idea what you are doing here or how to get out, it is your task to find out.

Instructions
------------

This is a simple text adventure game. It accepts commands on the form "verb
noun", for example: "take key". A full list of commands is given below. Your
first object of the game is to figure out what the object of the game is,
then to carry out the task that has been presented for you.

The game recognises these one-word commands:

 * "n", "s", "e", "w": Directional movement.
 * "i": Display inventory.
 * "look": Display room description.
 * "quit": Exit the game.
 * "license": Display license terms (not in the 4k version).

The game recognises these verbs, which must be used with a noun:

 "take", "pick up", "lift", "read", "talk to", "unlock", "open", "turn",
 "hit", "punch", "kick", "kill", "pour", "empty", "drink", "throw",
 "look at", "examine", "drop".
