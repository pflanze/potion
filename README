Game instructions
-----------------

Please see the file potion.txt for instructions.

Building
--------

The program has been compiled for three configurations:

* Linux

This should build on any sane Linux installation with GCC. It ought to build
on most platforms with GCC, but it has only been tested on Linux. Run "make
local" to build the Linux binary.

* Commodore 64
* Commodore 64 4K

These platforms require cc65 <URL:http://www.cc65.org/> to compile the
target binary, and pucrunch <URL:http://www.cs.tut.fi/~albert/Dev/pucrunch/>
to compress the resulting binary. The regular target uses the long
descriptions as in the Linux version, the small target uses shorter
descriptions and some optimized algorithms (mostly in-line assembly) to
reduce the size to fit in the 4K requirement for the 2003 Minigame
competition. Run "make c64" to build the regular C64 target and "make
c64small" to build the C64 4K target.
